### HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE

> **DO NOT FORK** this is meant to be used from **[Use this template](https://github.com/qiayuanl/legged_template_controller/generate)** feature.

1. Click on **[Use this template](https://github.com/qiayuanl/legged_template_controller/generate)**
3. Give a name to your repo, this name will be your ROS package name 
   (e.g. `rss25_controllers`, `koushil_controller`, **all lowercase and underscores separation for the name should be used!**)
3. Wait until the first run of CI finishes  
   (Github Actions will process the template and commit to your new repo)
4. Then clone your new project to the colcon workspace (e.g. `colcon_ws/src`) and happy coding!
